### Welcome to my Profile 👋

### My name is Rahaf, and I live in Germany. I'm currently a student of web development, passionate about crafting functional and visually appealing websites. My journey in tech is driven by a love for learning and continuous improvement.
##Please note that I am currently working on my portfolio. A link to it will be added to my GitHub once it's completed.

## Hobbies

#### Besides coding 💻, I enjoy the following:

1. **Taking care of my family 👪**

2. **Reading📚:** 

   I studied English Literature and definitely had to read a lot of long novels, plays, and poems. My favorite book is **Wuthering Heights**, the only novel by *Emily Brontë*.

3. **Learning Languages🌍:**
 
   Whether it’s spoken languages or programming languages, I enjoy the challenge and satisfaction of mastering new tongues.

#### My Favorite Place to Visit:

One of my favorite places to visit is the iconic [Colosseum in Rome, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Colosseum_in_Rome,_Italy_-_April_2007.jpg). This ancient amphitheater, with its rich history and magnificent architecture, never fails to inspire me. 🏛️

## Goals

- **Short-term:** Complete the web development course and build a portfolio.
- **Long-term:** Secure a position as a web developer and contribute to open-source projects.
