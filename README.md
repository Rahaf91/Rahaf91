### Welcome to my Profile 👋

### My name is Rahaf, and I live in Germany. I’m a passionate Junior Web Developer who recently completed an intensive Web Development bootcamp. 

## Hobbies

#### Besides coding 💻, I enjoy the following:

1. **Taking care of my family 👪**

2. **Reading📚:** 

   I studied English Literature and definitely had to read a lot of long novels, plays, and poems. My favorite book is **Wuthering Heights**, the only novel by *Emily Brontë*.

3. **Learning Languages🌍:**
 
   Whether it’s spoken languages or programming languages, I enjoy the challenge and satisfaction of mastering new tongues.

#### My Favorite Place to Visit:

One of my favorite places to visit is the iconic [Colosseum in Rome, Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Colosseum_in_Rome,_Italy_-_April_2007.jpg). This ancient amphitheater, with its rich history and magnificent architecture, never fails to inspire me. 🏛️
